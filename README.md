The code contained here is my resolution to a challenge project proposed by instructor professor Maximillian (Max) Schwarzm√ºller on his "React - The Complete Guide" Course, ministered through the Udemy platform.

In this project, (a simple page to create mock projects and add tasks to them) various topics and react competencies where explored, such as:

- React Strict Mode
- TailwindCss
- React hooks and tools, such as: useState, useRef, forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, portals.
- Conditional Rendering
- Prop drilling
- Generic, reusable components
